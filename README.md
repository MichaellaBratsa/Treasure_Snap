Treasure Snap is an Android application that combines camera functionality, QR code scanning, and map visualization to support a treasure-hunting experience. 
Users can capture photos with location metadata, scan QR codes to access related online content, and view discovered treasures on an interactive Google Map with marker clustering. 
The project demonstrates the use of CameraX, ML Kit, location services, and map-based UI design in Android development.
